## Features

- Supports scanning for SQL injection vulnerabilities using various payloads.
- Can operate with GET or POST HTTP methods.
- Allows targeting of specific parameters in requests.
- Configurable number of threads for performance optimization.
- Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SQL_Injection_Finder.git
   cd SQL_Injection_Finder
   ```
3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed. If not, download and install it from python.org.

## Usage
To run the SQL Injection Finder, use the following command in your terminal:
  ```bash
  python3 Sql_Injection_Finder.py
  ```
### **Input Parameters**
- URL or path to Burp request file: Provide the target URL or path to a saved request file.
- HTTP method: Specify whether to use GET or POST.
- Parameters: Enter parameters as key-value pairs (e.g., username=admin&password=password).
- Number of threads: Specify the number of threads to use for scanning.
- Specific parameter to target: Optionally, enter a specific parameter to focus the scan on.
### Example
Hereâ€™s a quick example of running the script:
  ```plaintext
  [*] Enter the URL or path to Burp request file: http://localhost/DVWA/login.php
  [*] Enter the HTTP method (GET/POST): post
  [*] Enter parameters as key=value, separated by &: username=admin&password=password
  [*] Enter the number of threads to use: 64
  ```
### Output
The script will display the results of the scan, including any detected vulnerabilities or payloads that did not result in a successful injection:
  ```plaintext
  [-] No Vulnerability Detected with Payload: ' OR '1'='1 for Parameter: password
  [-] No Vulnerability Detected with Payload: 1' ORDER BY 2--+ for Parameter: password
  ...
  ```
